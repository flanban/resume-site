      The website was developed using Ruby on Rails, HTML(haml), css(SCSS) and javascript. Content was delivered with the Flickr and Vimeo APIs. The visual design was put together using a combination of photoshop and the browser. The typeface used is Lato by Łukasz Dziedzic; webfonts delivered via google fonts.

      The client wanted a portfolio site for his cinematography and photography work. He needed a custom design, the ability to able to manage content and didn't want to use a canned solution. Building a simple CMS was out of his budget, so noticing that he keeps his work on Flickr and Vimeo I decided to populate his site using their APIs.
