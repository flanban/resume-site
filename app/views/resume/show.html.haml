    %h2 Summary
    %p Professionally, Iâ€™ve enjoyed six years working with at-scale digital publishing brands. Currently, I work on contracts and freelance projects. At my various professional roles I've worked as either a designer, a frontend or a mix of the two. Having a background covering fine arts, print design, plus years pursuing optimal frontend methods while happily stumbling through rails apps has given me an interestingly rounded skill set, spanning visual design and front end development.

      %p At Aol, I primarily designed for fanhouse.com, which was a top five editorially driven sports news site. However, with significant readership and a strong product team. I also helped design mmafighting.com, which ironically Vox Media wound up acquiring from Aol, while I was at Vox.
