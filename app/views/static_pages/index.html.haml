  %h2 Summary
  %p Professionally, I’ve enjoyed six years working with at-scale digital publishing brands. Currently, I work on contracts and freelance projects. At my various professional roles I've worked as either a designer, a frontend or a mix of the two. Having a fine arts background, combined with a degree in print design, plus years pursuing optimal frontend methods while happily stumbling through rails apps; I've wound up with an interestingly rounded skill set, bridging design and development.
  %p With a dedicated eye towards learning and improvement, I use my professional visual and UI/UX design experiences to help guide my implementation of front-end code in a manner that compliments the design’s intentions, while remaining cohesive with the backend technologies used.
